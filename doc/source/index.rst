OSCARS 1.0
==========

Short for "On-demand Secure Circuits and Advance Reservation System," OSCARS is a freely available open-source product. As developed by the Department of Energyâ€™s high-performance science network ESnet, OSCARS was designed by network engineers who specialize in supporting the U.S. national laboratory system and its data-intensive collaborations. This project is a complete redesign of the original OSCARS to improve performance and maintainability.
