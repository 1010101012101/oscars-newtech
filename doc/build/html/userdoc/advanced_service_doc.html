<p>OSCARS 1.0 supports a number of all-new routing capabilities which provide an unprecedented amount of user control over how the PCE identifies working solutions. All of these services may be triggered without alteration to the code, and without the need for modifying configuration parameters when launching OSCARS. This document discusses the PCE service enhancement suite, while <tt class="xref doc docutils literal"><span class="pre">???</span></tt> provides details on how the user can exert control over the flow through the PCE to request each of the described services. The following table offers a listing of the services discussed throughout the remainder of the document. Note: Forward-direction circuit is denoted as <strong>A-Z</strong>, while reverse is denoted as <strong>Z-A</strong>.</p>

<p>Figure 8: Asymmetric Bandwidth Reservation with 100 Mbps AZ and 50 Mbps ZA. Only 50 Mbps bandwidth is available on the (N, M) link.</p>
<p>When the AZ and ZA directions of a requested path do not require the same bandwidth (e.g. the control signal returning from the destination only needs 50 Mbps, while the traffic in the forward direction requires 100 Mbps), the user can specify asymmetric (non-identical) requested bandwidths for a pipe. A link is only chosen during pathfinding if the matching link in the opposite direction (e.g. links (M, N) and (N, M) ) has sufficient bandwidth to support the requested bandwidth in that direction. An example where the user requests 100 Mbps in the AZ direction, and only 25 Mbps in the return direction, is depicted in Fig. 8. The user would be unable to get a path through this network if they requested 100 Mbps for both AZ and ZA, but is able to by requested a lower bandwidth for the ZA path.</p>

<p>Figure 10: Service Layer topology, including two unidirectional MPLS routes treated as a bidirectional link.</p>
<p>It is possible for the MPLS layer to support non-identical forward (AZ) and return (ZA) paths. The user can request this by marking a particular pipe as Non-Palindromic, allowing the PCE to use (possibly) different paths through the MPLS layer to provision the request. This is accomplished by creating a Service Layer Topology for each non-palindromic request. This service layer topology (example shown in Fig. 10) consists of all Ethernet layer devices, along with multiple logical links representing routes between each pair of switches that can be connected through the MPLS layer. These logical links are found by identifying the shortest available unidirectional AZ and ZA pair between each Ethernet “entry point” into the MPLS layer (Fig. 9). A shortest path algorithm is then run on the service layer topology, as is done in the basic PCE service, to determine the best AZ and ZA path for a request through the network.</p>

<p>Figure 11: Multipoint Request, in the form of two requested pipes.</p>
<p>Figure 12: Multipoint paths through the network.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, users can specify multiple requested pipes within one request, and in such a way can establish Multipoint or Mesh reservations. Fig. 11 shows such a request, and Fig. 12 shows the matching physical paths through the network used to provision the request. Users can submit any number of pipes in a request, and the PCE will attempt to provision them all. As the pipes will compete with each other for resources, the pipes are sorted and pathfinding is tried in order. If it is impossible to provision them in that sequence, the order will be reversed and pathfinding is attempted again. If it is still not possible to find a path for every pipe, the request fails.</p>

<p>A pipe submitted to the PCE can have a specified list of network nodes (devices or ports) that must be included in the associated forward and return path. The network is pruned down to just the specified nodes, and if a feasible path can be found, the path is used. Otherwise, the route is treated as partially specified, and the specified nodes are connected using a shortest path algorithm. If the desired nodes cannot be connected, then the request fails.</p>

<p>In addition to providing nodes that must be included in the path, nodes that must not be included can be specified as well. All links connected to these “blacklisted” nodes are removed from the topology before pathfinding. As usual, if a path cannot be found, the request fails.</p>

<p>Network elements, particularly links, experience failures almost regularly. Any traffic traversing a link at the time of failure can be lost, and service may be interrupted. To mitigate this loss, a backup path can be established alongside the primary path requested by a user. If the user indicates that a pipe must be provisioned using Total survivability, a link-disjoint path pair will be found between the requested pipe’s two junctions. No links will be shared between these primary and backup paths. Each path in the pair will be palindromic; in other words, each will have both a forward/reverse, or AZ/ZA flow. If a disjoint path pair through the network cannot be found, then the request fails.</p>

<p>Figure 16: Service Layer abstraction of MPLS-only Link-Disjoint survivability. Each MPLS service layer link represents a disjoint path pair through the MPLS layer.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the user only needs disjoint paths in the MPLS layer, or Partial survivability, a service layer topology is constructed through the same approach used for non-palindromic requests. The only difference is that each undirectional logical link represents a disjoint path pair in that direction. For simplicity, the logical link in the reverse direction must be palindromic with the forward direction link; in other words, the forward logical link represents a disjoint pair of forward paths, while the reverse direction logical link represents that same path pair, but with the links in reverse. If no disjoint path pairs through the MPLS layer can be found, and it is not possible to establish a route without going through the MPLS layer, then the request fails.</p>

<p>The user can request any number of disjoint paths for either Total or Partial survivability. This is implemented through an iterative version of Bhandari’s Algorithm, which will find the specified number of link-disjoint paths K (or the maximum number of disjoint paths less than K).</p>
<p>As of February 1, 2017, K-path survivability is implemented only in the BhandariPCE, and there is not yet any avenue in the Survivability PCE API to support the service at this time. This connective tissue will be incorporated into a future release version.</p>

<h2>VLAN Translation/Swapping<a class="headerlink" href="#vlan-translation-swapping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Figure 17: VLAN Translation example where a different VLAN tag can be assigned to intermediate ports if a requested tag is not available.</p>
<p>While not a specific service that can be requested, VLAN Translation (or Swapping), is a procedure used in the TranslationPCE to assign VLAN tags to a reserved path. VLAN translation allows one VLAN tag, possibly different than the tag(s) requested, to be used for the intermediate ports in a path. The VLANs available at each port (or at each switch) are encapsulated in a set of IntRange objects, each of which represents a contiguous range of VLAN IDs. For example, IntRanges [5, 10] and [15, 20] could be available at a specific port, while IDs outside of that range are unavailable. To perform VLAN swapping, the PCE take the path returned from pathfinding and retrieve the available ranges from each port involved in the path (along with each port on each switch in the path, if those ports aren&#8217;t already in the path). The problem ends up being similar to the Set Cover problem - choose the minimum set of VLANs that will cover all involved ports, with the following restrictions: fixtures(ingress/egress points) must use one of the requested VLAN tags (could be different for different fixtures), all intermediate ports along the path must use the same VLAN tag, and all ports on any switches involved must use the same VLAN tag.</p>
<p>Major steps:
(1) Check if there are any VLAN tags available across the path (including fixtures). If so, use one of those.
(2) If (1) was not successful: For each fixture, assign a requested &amp; available VLAN tag. Check if any of those tags are available across the intermediate ports of the path. If so, assign it to those ports as well (if they have not have VLANs assigned yet). If any fixture cannot have an assignment, then the request cannot be provisioned.
(3) If the intermediate ports are still not assigned, determine if there are any tags that are available across the entire intermediate path. If so, assign them. If not, the request cannot be provisioned.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">due to the above requirement that all ports on a switch are assigned a tag if that tag is assigned to any one of the ports, multiple VLANs may be assigned to a port throughout this process.</p>
